                    <p>Recognition is the heartbeat of EPAM culture. It's the driving force that fuels passion,
                        encourages collaboration, and inspires innovation. Acknowledging achievements, both big and
                        small, creates a positive ripple effect, enhancing teamwork, boosting morale, and strengthening
                        our organizational identity. Recognition is not merely a gesture; it's a powerful catalyst that
                        propels us toward excellence.</p>
