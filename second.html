                <h3 class="role__header">Key Benefits:</h3>
                <ul class="role__list">
                    <li>Motivation and Promotion: Recognizing Resource Managers' impact on the company fosters
                        motivation and
                        encourages their continuous dedication to the role.</li>
                    <li>High-Potential Visibility: The initiative highlights high-potential Resource Managers, giving

                    Managers. This approach encourages continuous dedication and highlights exceptional achievements
                    that contribute to the organization's overall growth and success.</p>
                <h3 class="role__header campaigns">Ongoing campaigns</h3>
                <p>The Ongoing Recognition Campaign aims to regularly celebrate Resource Managers' continuous
                    contributions and impact on the organization. By providing periodic recognition, this campaign
